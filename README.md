# DecentraCore Frontend (App)

This project is the **frontend module** of the broader **DecentraCore ecosystem**, a full-stack blockchain portfolio demonstrating supply chain, finance, and real estate solutions on private EVM-compatible networks. It integrates directly with the other DecentraCore modules (backend API, local blockchain node, event listeners, and database services).

---

## üìå Project Overview

Originally bootstrapped from an old **Angular template that relied on jQuery AJAX**, this codebase has been **refactored and modernized** into a **fully functional Web3-enabled Angular frontend**.  
It now leverages **TypeScript, Angular best practices, and Web3 integrations** to interact seamlessly with the DecentraCore smart contracts and backend services.

The app connects to:
- **DecentraCore Blockchain Module** ‚Üí Provides the Hardhat-based private network, deployed smart contracts, and WebSocket event streaming.
- **DecentraCore Backend (Express + MongoDB)** ‚Üí Serves as the RESTful API for querying contract data, retrieving event logs, and interacting with the database.
- **DecentraCore Metadata Service** ‚Üí Manages NFT and escrow metadata for the Real Estate module.

This tight coupling allows the frontend to present **real-time, verifiable blockchain interactions** in the domains of:
- **Finance**: Constant Product AMM (CPAMM), Constant Sum AMM (CSAMM), and Order Book Market Maker (OBMM).
- **Supply Chain**: Inventory management and provenance tracking.
- **Real Estate**: Escrow contracts, escrow factories, and NFT marketplace (ERC-1155).

## üåê Integration with DecentraCore

This module is designed to operate as the **frontend layer** of the DecentraCore ecosystem:

1. **Blockchain Module**  
   Provides local private EVM-compatible network (Hardhat) with deployed smart contracts.  
   This frontend consumes ABI files from the `/app/src/app/blockchain/abis` directory.

2. **Backend API (Express + MongoDB)**  
   REST endpoints (`/api/...`) return structured data from contract events and DB.  
   Angular HttpClient replaces the old jQuery AJAX calls.

3. **Event Listeners**  
   Containerized Node.js services keep MongoDB in sync with blockchain events.  
   This frontend queries the DB through the backend.

4. **Metadata Server**  
   Used in Real Estate module to serve NFT metadata for escrowed properties.
